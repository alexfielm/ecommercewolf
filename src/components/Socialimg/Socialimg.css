   If appropriate, I will assume the icons are black by default and we need them white if the footer is dark.
   However, let's stick to size first. I will comment out filter for now unless I know the context is dark. 
   Wait, the uploaded image has a dark background. So the icons should probably be white.
   But the user just said "socialimg.jsx", I don't know where it's used exactly (Footer?).
   Let's check usage or just set size.
   Actually, looking at the previous context, Socialimg might be in the footer.
   The user uploaded an image showing a dark footer with white icons.
   I will set the size to 24x24px.
